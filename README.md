# Cancer-Prediction-using-Classification-and-ANN

This project is focused on predicting cancer among patients based on their tumor diagnosis details. Leveraging a dataset comprising patient tumor diagnosis records with specific tumor attributes represented in columns, the study aims to develop a predictive model using classification and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) techniques. By analyzing this data and applying machine learning methodologies, the project endeavors to create an accurate model capable of identifying patients with cancer based on their diagnosis profiles.
